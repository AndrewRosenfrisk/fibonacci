# Fibonacci

## About

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern credited to Italian mathematician 
Fibonacci in the 13th century (though others had discovered it even earlier). The sequence 
begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The sequence continues forever:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987 . . .

The Fibonacci sequence has applications in music composition, stock market prediction, the 
pattern of florets in the head of sunflowers, and many other areas. This program lets you 
calculate the sequence as high as you are willing to go. More information about the Fibonacci 
sequence can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number.
